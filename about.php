            <p>I usually plan and book our holidays myself and was a little cautious but thought I'd give booking with paradise travel agency a go. Booking with paradise travel agency was easy and trouble free. My consultant and other staff were very helpful and friendly. Documentation etc. was received promptly and the emails received prior to our trip were very helpful, ensuring we had everything in order before our departure. When planning our next trip I will certainly look at what is available and I would have no hesitation in recommending paradise travel agency to family or friends.</p>

            <p>Deals always tend to be hard to beat on travel online. We've booked with them for years for this reason. On this occasion, it took a long while (many days) on a few occasions for travel online to return phone calls, we had to chase them up, and some minor details were incorrect on itineraries received (we had to make an adjustments which lengthened the process). Overall I would book again and recommend on the basis the deals are hard to pass up.</p>
